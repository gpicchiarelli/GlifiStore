# Package CI operator guide

Status: framework implemented and locally exercised; **no packaging gate is closed and no
packaging evidence has ever been retained from a tagged release**

This is the operator-facing half of the packaging framework. The declarative half — which
backends exist, which targets and checks they owe, and how deep each CI profile may go — is
generated into [package-status.md](package-status.md) from
[`engineering/distribution/package-matrix.yaml`](../../engineering/distribution/package-matrix.yaml).
Neither page is evidence: the only packaging proofs are the retained `*-package-evidence.json`
documents described below.

## The pipeline in one pass

| Step | Owner | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolve version identity | [`generate_release_context.py`](../../engineering/tools/generate_release_context.py) from [`VERSION`](../../VERSION) and [`ABI_VERSION`](../../ABI_VERSION) | `release-context.json` |
| Expand the backend matrix | [`generate_package_matrix.py`](../../engineering/tools/generate_package_matrix.py) | `package-matrix.json` |
| Run one backend lifecycle | [`scripts/package-ci.sh`](../../scripts/package-ci.sh) → `scripts/lib/package-backend-{linux,macos,bsd}.sh` | `check-plan.json`, per-check logs, `<backend>-<profile>-<stage>-package-evidence.json` |
| Refuse dishonest evidence | [`validate_package_evidence.py`](../../engineering/tools/validate_package_evidence.py) | non-zero exit |
| Decide the CI profile and close it | [`package_ci_plan.py`](../../engineering/tools/package_ci_plan.py) | `package-ci-plan.json`, `package-ci-closure.json` |

No version, backend, runner, timeout or retention appears in
[`package-ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/package-ci.yml): the workflow calls the two tools above
and uploads what they produce.

## Run it locally

Requirements: `python3` with `PyYAML` and `jsonschema`, a git checkout (the context reads the
commit), and nothing else for the structural rows.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user PyYAML jsonschema

# One backend, pull-request depth.
./scripts/package-ci.sh --profile pr --backend deb

# Every backend the profile declares.
./scripts/package-ci.sh --profile main --all

# One lifecycle stage only (the thin wrappers share the same arguments).
./scripts/package-build.sh --profile main --backend rpm
./scripts/package-verify.sh --profile main --backend rpm
```

Output lands under `build/package-ci/<version>/<commit>/<profile>/<run-id>/<backend>/<stage>/`,
one isolated directory per run. Exit status is non-zero only when a backend reports `FAIL` or a
tool refuses; a run made entirely of `BLOCKED` rows succeeds and says so in the evidence, because
"this host cannot run that" is a fact, not a failure.

Depth is opt-in, and by design:

| Environment | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| default | structural rows only: release context, matrix, rendered packaging metadata, reference-port and account-marker reads |
| `GLYPHASTORE_PACKAGE_CI_CONTAINER=1` | `deb`/`rpm` build, install, service and removal inside the digest-pinned container |
| `GLYPHASTORE_PACKAGE_CI_NATIVE=1` | the same rows on a disposable root host; on macOS, the MacPorts/Homebrew native lifecycle |
| `--candidate DIR` | admit a sealed release-candidate directory; the native lifecycles refuse to build without it |

`GLYPHASTORE_PACKAGE_CI_NATIVE=1` installs into the host package manager and creates system
accounts and services. Use a disposable machine or VM; never a workstation.

The FreeBSD and OpenBSD native lifecycles additionally require a native host, root, a complete
ports tree, the sealed candidate and the `PORTS_ACCOUNT_REGISTERED` marker. That marker records a
real upstream UID/GID allocation and is never created by CI or by this guide
([bsd-packaging.md](bsd-packaging.md)).

## Read the evidence

Each run writes one evidence document per backend and stage:

```bash
run=build/package-ci/0.1.0/<commit>/pr/<run-id>
python3 engineering/tools/validate_package_evidence.py validate \
  "$run/deb/full/deb-pr-full-package-evidence.json" \
  --release-context "$run/release-context.json" \
  --backend deb --profile pr --artifact-root "$run/deb/full"
```

Read it in this order:

1. `result` — the backend outcome, which can never be better than its checks.
2. `lifecycle_state` — how far up the chain this run actually got (`NONE` … `RELEASE_ADMITTED`).
3. `subject` — `source_tree` means no artifact bytes exist; `artifact` carries the SHA-256 that an
   admission later has to match.
4. `checks[]` — each check with its `status`, `category` and the retained log in `evidence_ref`.
5. `limitations` and `residuals` — what this document deliberately does not prove.
6. `producer` — `workflow: local-unattested` / `run_id: local` marks a local run, which the release
   profile refuses to cite.

Statuses are not shades of pass:

| Status | Meaning | What it is not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PASS` | the check ran and succeeded, with a retained non-empty log | never inferred from a sibling check |
| `FAIL` | the check ran and failed | fails the run |
| `NOT_RUN` | the check could have run here and did not | not a pass, not a waiver |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | the check cannot apply to this backend | must be justified by the backend |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE_INITIAL_BASELINE` | no release precedes this version, so there is nothing to upgrade from | becomes `NOT_RUN` the moment a predecessor exists |
| `BLOCKED` | a prerequisite is missing: no container runtime, no native host, no sealed candidate, no account marker | not a defect and not a pass |
| `OPEN_GATE` | the capability is unproven by construction (upstream acceptance, a service the packaging does not install) | never closes by rerunning CI |

A `category` bounds how a passing row may be read: a `structural` pass says the repository-side
metadata is coherent, and says nothing about a built package, a running service or an upstream
acceptance.

## Bump a package revision without a new product version

`VERSION` is the only source of truth for the product version. Packaging-only changes (a corrected
dependency, a service unit fix) use the package revision instead:

```bash
./scripts/package-ci.sh --profile main --backend deb --package-revision 1
```

The revision flows through `release-context.json` into every backend naming convention
(`0.1.0-2` for `deb`/`rpm`, `0.1.0_1` for `macports`, `PORTREVISION` for FreeBSD), and never into
`VERSION`, the ABI or the wire protocol. Changing the packaged upstream bytes is a product-version
change, not a revision bump: a release artifact that differs by a single byte needs a new version,
because publication refuses to clobber an existing tag or asset.

## Add a backend

1. Add the backend id to `BACKENDS` in
   [`package_framework.py`](../../engineering/tools/package_framework.py) and its package kind to
   `ARTIFACT_KINDS`. An id outside that list is refused everywhere.
2. Describe it in [`package-matrix.yaml`](../../engineering/distribution/package-matrix.yaml):
   `status: PLANNED` or `STRUCTURAL`, `required_for_release: false`, its targets (a container
   target must be pinned by digest), the checks it owes, the required checks per profile, and its
   honest `limitations`.
3. Write the adapter under `scripts/lib/` and its driver under `engineering/tools/`. The adapter
   decides statuses only from what it observed, records a log per check, and emits evidence through
   `validate_package_evidence.py emit`. It must never synthesise an account marker, an upstream
   acceptance or a `PASS` for a check it skipped.
4. Add negative tests under [`scripts/tests/`](../../scripts/tests): a refused matrix, a refused
   evidence document, and the lifecycle statuses on a host without the prerequisites.
5. Regenerate the derived view and re-run the validators:

   ```bash
   python3 engineering/tools/generate_package_matrix.py validate
   python3 engineering/tools/generate_package_status.py --write-generated
   python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests
   python3 engineering/tools/validate_assurance.py
   python3 engineering/tools/validate_documentation.py
   ```

6. Leave `required_for_release: false`. Promotion needs `LIFECYCLE_VERIFIED` evidence retained from
   CI, a release-policy artifact in
   [`release_bundle.py`](../../engineering/tools/release_bundle.py), an ADR and a gate update — in
   that order, never a silent flip of the flag.

Windows and Apple `.pkg` are refused by the matrix validator, not merely unimplemented. Both need
an accepted ADR first ([package-status.md](package-status.md) lists the prerequisites).

## The release path

[`release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml) builds the candidate once, seals it, and only
then lets packaging run:

- `freebsd` and `openbsd` are `required_for_release: true`. Their native jobs consume the sealed
  candidate and produce the package evidence that
  [`release_bundle.py`](../../engineering/tools/release_bundle.py) demands. They currently close as
  `OPEN_GATE`, so the release policy stays red until the upstream account allocation exists.
- `deb`, `rpm`, `macports` and `homebrew` run through a `release`-profile call of
  [`package-ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/package-ci.yml) with the sealed candidate. That call is
  deliberately outside the verify job's dependencies: those backends are diagnostic and cannot admit
  a release artifact.
- Publication never rebuilds, never clobbers an asset and refuses an existing tag.

Three admission tools plus the CI orchestrator are covered by tests and **wired fail-closed**:

- [`package-ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/package-ci.yml) closure runs
  [`run_package_admission.py`](../../engineering/tools/run_package_admission.py) whenever a sealed
  candidate is supplied (the release-profile `workflow_call`).
- [`release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs a dedicated `package-admission` job for
  FreeBSD/OpenBSD `release_evidence` (adapted without inventing package-matrix PASS rows).

Both retain `package-admission.json`, `upgrade-baseline.json`, `artifact-manifest.json` and
`installed-sdk-matrix.json`. `--allow-blocking` keeps known residual blockers visible inside the
report without inventing `admitted: true`; the job fails only when the orchestrator cannot produce a
schema-valid report. Local reproduction:

```bash
python3 engineering/tools/run_package_admission.py \
  --profile release --candidate dist/release-candidate \
  --evidence-root build/package-evidence --allow-blocking --replace \
  --output-dir build/package-admission
```

## What this pipeline does not prove

- The `deb`/`rpm` container lifecycle has retained nightly evidence at `FUNCTIONALLY_VERIFIED`
  (see [wave5-l7-residuals.md](wave5-l7-residuals.md)); container dispatch now starts systemd as
  PID 1 when cgroup/privileged are available so `service-lifecycle` can PASS on the next retained
  run (otherwise it stays `BLOCKED`).
- MacPorts and Homebrew have no hosted runner allowed to install into the host package manager, and
  neither installs a startup item that a retained run has ever started, so `service-lifecycle` is an
  open gate for both.
- `package-upgrade` has never run positively anywhere: it is `NOT_APPLICABLE_INITIAL_BASELINE`
  until a predecessor exists, then `NOT_RUN` until a sealed N−1 package is admitted.
- The cross-SDK post-install matrix against a package-installed daemon is `NOT_RUN`, so Wave F
  admission reports stay `admitted: false` by construction even though the tools now run in CI.
- In-repo packaging is the project's own pipeline. It is not a Debian, Fedora, MacPorts, Homebrew,
  FreeBSD or OpenBSD acceptance, and nothing here may be described as one.

The full ledger lives in [wave5-l7-residuals.md](wave5-l7-residuals.md); the gate states live in
[`engineering/gates/quality-gates.yaml`](../../engineering/gates/quality-gates.yaml) and the derived
[production readiness](../production-readiness.md) view.
