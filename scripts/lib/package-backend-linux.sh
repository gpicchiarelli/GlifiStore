# Debian / RPM backend module for scripts/package-ci.sh (Wave B).
#
# Everything that decides a status lives in
# engineering/tools/run_linux_package_backend.py: it renders debian/ or the spec
# from the release context, chooses between running inside the digest-pinned
# container, running natively on a disposable host, or running nothing at all,
# and writes the check plan and the evidence itself.
#
# Both dispatch modes are opt-in because both are destructive or expensive:
#   GLYPHASTORE_PACKAGE_CI_CONTAINER=1  build and install inside the pinned image
#   GLYPHASTORE_PACKAGE_CI_NATIVE=1     build and install on this host, as root
# Without either, the backend reports the metadata rows it really resolved and
# BLOCKED or NOT_RUN for the rest.
#
# Sourced by package-ci.sh; uses its root, tools, profile, stage, output_dir,
# release_context and candidate_dir variables.

# Hand the sealed candidate to the driver when package-ci.sh was given one. The
# driver verifies the seal itself and refuses to build a release profile without it.
