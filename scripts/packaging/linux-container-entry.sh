# Entry point for the digest-pinned container that runs the Linux packaging lifecycle.
#
# The base images are minimal and do not ship Python, so this script cannot be
# Python and cannot assume anything beyond a POSIX shell and the distribution
# package manager. It installs just enough to reach the driver and then hands
# over; every status decision belongs to
# engineering/tools/run_linux_package_backend.py.
#
# Mount contract, established by that driver:
#   /src                   repository, read-only
#   /out                   evidence directory, writable
#   /release-context.json  release context, read-only
#   /candidate             sealed release candidate, read-only (optional)
