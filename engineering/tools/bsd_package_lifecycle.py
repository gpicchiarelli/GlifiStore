"""Turn observed BSD packaging facts into honest package evidence.

`scripts/lib/package-backend-bsd.sh` probes the host, the reference port, the
upstream service-account marker and the sealed candidate, then optionally runs
`scripts/test-freebsd-package-lifecycle.sh` or its OpenBSD analogue. This module
owns the only mapping from those observations to package-framework check
statuses, the lifecycle state, the result and the emit arguments, so that:

* structural, native-build, package, service and upstream-acceptance rows stay
  separate and a structural pass never implies any of the others;
* `PORTS_ACCOUNT_REGISTERED` is read, never created, and an absent marker keeps
  the native lifecycle BLOCKED;
* a native log without its own PASSED marker is a FAIL, never an inferred pass;
* upgrade from N-1 stays NOT_APPLICABLE_INITIAL_BASELINE or NOT_RUN until a
  sealed prior release package exists (Linux deb/rpm exercise the walk when
  GLYPHASTORE_N1_PACKAGE_DIR supplies those bytes);
* the result stays OPEN_GATE while upstream acceptance is unproven, however far
  the native lifecycle got.
