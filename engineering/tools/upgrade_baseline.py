"""Resolve and admit the sealed N-1 upgrade baseline for GlyphaStore packaging.

A package upgrade may only be proven against the bytes of a release that was
actually published and sealed, so this module never assumes that the baseline is
"the current version minus one". It orders every release tag by SemVer
precedence, records why each candidate was accepted or rejected, and keeps the
greatest candidate that is annotated, published, complete, sealed and
ABI-compatible.

The distinction between the three honest pre-upgrade states is the point of the
tool: nothing precedes the current version is an initial baseline, something
precedes it but no sealed release is admissible is BLOCKED, and an admissible
baseline that this run did not exercise is NOT_RUN. A first release therefore
cannot be faked by hiding a draft or incomplete predecessor.

Admission re-verifies the downloaded bundle against the digests recorded in the
prior release's own manifest and refuses a bundle that carries the current
commit, so N-1 can never be rebuilt from HEAD.
