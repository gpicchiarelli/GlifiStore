# Configuration and data retention policy

Intent shared by every packaging backend, and — for the Debian and RPM backends —
the behaviour their `config-preservation` and `package-remove` checks exercise.
Those checks only run where a package can actually be installed and removed: inside
the digest-pinned container or on a disposable root Linux host. Everywhere else
they report `BLOCKED`, no gate references them, and the policy below is intent
rather than proof. The BSD and macOS backends have not executed it at all.

## Categories

| Category | Example | Install | Upgrade | Remove | Purge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program files | `bin/glifistored`, `lib/libglifistore.so.*` | installed | replaced | removed | removed |
| Configuration | `glifistored.conf` | installed from the sample; an existing file is never overwritten | operator edits preserved | preserved | removed, and the now-empty `/etc/glifistore` with it |
| Durable data | Store directory (`/var/lib/glifistore` on Linux, `/var/db/glifistore` on FreeBSD) | created, owned by the service account | untouched | preserved | never removed by a package action |
| Logs and runtime state | pid files, sockets | created at runtime | untouched | removed if empty | removed if empty |

## Rules

1. A package action must never destroy durable Store data. Data removal is an
   explicit operator action, not a side effect of `remove` or `purge`.
2. Configuration modified by the operator survives reinstall and upgrade. Backends
   express this with their native mechanism (`@sample` on the BSD ports,
   `conffiles` on Debian, `%config(noreplace)` on RPM).
3. The service account owns the data directory; packages must not widen its
   permissions. The account itself is never deleted, because files elsewhere on the
   system may still be owned by it.
4. Removing a package must not leave a running daemon. The package stops the
   service; it does not ask the operator to.

## Per-backend resolution

`apt purge` removes the configuration and the now-empty `/etc/glifistore`, and
leaves `/var/lib/glifistore` and the service account alone. `dpkg` marks
`glifistored.conf` as a conffile, so an operator edit produces a prompt rather
than a silent overwrite; the lifecycle's reinstall states the policy explicitly
with `--force-confdef --force-confold`, meaning the operator's version wins.

RPM has no purge action, so removal is the terminal state for the configuration:
`%config(noreplace)` leaves an edited file in place, or renames it to `.rpmsave`.
Either way the edit survives, and the durable directory is `%dir`-owned but never
deleted.

Stopping the service on removal goes through the unit's `TimeoutStopSec=90s`, which
outwaits the daemon's shutdown drain. Neither backend shortens it, so removal does
not truncate a durable shutdown.
